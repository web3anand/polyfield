# Polymarket Dashboard

## Overview

A gamified dashboard application for Polymarket traders that visualizes trading performance, positions, and achievements. The application allows users to connect via their Polymarket username and view comprehensive trading analytics including PnL graphs, active positions, trading volume metrics, and achievement badges. The UI combines gaming aesthetics with modern fintech design principles, drawing inspiration from platforms like Steam, Robinhood, and DraftKings.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Design aesthetic: Lighter.gg inspired - sleek dark theme, clean Inter typography, minimal design, sharp contrasts, professional trading interface with game-style aesthetics.

## Recent Changes (October 2025)

- **Header Redesign**: Implemented persistent sticky search bar at top for quick user switching
- **Profile Section**: Moved profile info below header with larger avatar, username, and wallet address display
- **Wallet Address**: Added copyable wallet address with visual feedback (check icon on copy)
- **Layout Optimization**: Removed Win Streak card for cleaner focus on key metrics
- **Portfolio Metric**: Changed "Total Portfolio Value" to "Open Positions Value" showing only active position values
- **Animations**: Added upward slide-in transition when dashboard loads for smooth UX
- **Search Enhancement**: Created compact mode for header search bar with autocomplete
- **Hidden Scrollbars**: Applied across positions table and activity feed for cleaner aesthetic

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- Wouter for client-side routing
- TanStack Query (React Query) for data fetching and caching
- Shadcn UI components built on Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom theme configuration
- Recharts for data visualization

**Design System:**
- Custom color scheme defined in CSS variables for both light and dark modes (lighter.gg dark aesthetic)
- "New York" style variant from Shadcn UI
- Clean typography using Inter font family (400, 500, 600, 700 weights)
- Minimal card treatments with subtle borders and consistent p-6 padding with hover-elevate
- Responsive grid layouts with consistent spacing:
  - Desktop: gap-6 for all major grids (stats, chart section, positions)
  - Mobile: gap-4 for compact layouts
- Color palette: text-chart-2 for positive PnL (green), text-destructive for negative (red), text-primary for selected states
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing units (text-xl headings, text-xs uppercase labels)

**Component Structure:**
- Dashboard page as the main view with username connection flow
- Persistent search bar in sticky header for quick user switching
- Profile section with avatar, username, and wallet address (with copy functionality)
- Modular components for different data visualizations:
  - PnL chart showing all-time performance (no time filters) with dynamic value in top corner
  - Positions table with sorting (PnL, Size, Market) and scrollable view (max 5 visible rows)
  - Recent activity feed with scrollable trade history
  - Key stat cards showing: Open Positions Value, All-Time PnL, Win Rate, Total Trades
  - Sidebar stat cards: Best Trade, Active Positions, Trading Volume
- Loading skeleton states for progressive UI rendering
- Username input with live autocomplete search suggestions (compact and full modes)
- Upward slide-in animation when dashboard loads
- Profile picture display with wallet address and copy button

**State Management:**
- React Query handles server state with infinite stale time and no automatic refetching
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Toast notifications for user feedback

### Backend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- Node.js with Express server
- TypeScript for type safety
- In-memory storage implementation (MemStorage class)
- Zod for runtime schema validation

**API Design:**
- RESTful endpoints under `/api` prefix
- Username-based dashboard data retrieval: `/api/dashboard/username/:username`
- User search functionality: `/api/users/search?q=:query&search_profiles=true`
- Polymarket Data API integration for fetching positions and trades
- Polymarket Gamma API integration for user search with profile lookup

**Data Flow:**
1. Client submits Polymarket username with live autocomplete
2. Backend searches Gamma API (with `search_profiles=true`) to resolve username to proxy wallet address
3. Backend fetches trading data from Data API using wallet address:
   - `/activity` endpoint: Complete ledger for cash balance calculation (deposits, withdrawals, trades, redeems, rewards, fees)
   - `/positions` endpoint: Active positions with unrealized PnL
   - `/trades` endpoint: Trade history for activity feed
4. Backend calculates PnL from activity ledger (authoritative source):
   - Cash balance = Î£(all activity deltas)
   - Realized PnL = cash balance - net deposits
   - All-time PnL = realized PnL + unrealized PnL from open positions
5. Backend generates PnL history chart data from chronological activity events
6. Client receives structured dashboard data and renders visualizations with accurate PnL values

**Error Handling:**
- Axios interceptors for API communication
- Graceful fallback to demo data when:
  - Username doesn't exist in Polymarket (USER_NOT_FOUND)
  - API returns 401/403/404 errors (authentication/authorization failures)
- Real users with no trading activity show actual empty state (not demo data)
- Network error propagation to client layer
- Request logging middleware with timing information and detailed debugging

### Database and Storage

**Current Implementation:**
- In-memory storage using Map data structure
- User entity with id and username fields
- No persistent storage (data cleared on server restart)

**Schema Design (shared/schema.ts):**
- Position: Trading positions with entry/current prices, PnL, and status
- Trade: Individual trade records with type, outcome, and profit
- PortfolioStats: Aggregated metrics like win rate, total volume, best/worst trades
- PnLDataPoint: Time-series data for chart visualization
- Achievement: Gamification badges with unlock status
- DashboardData: Composite type containing all dashboard information

**Database Architecture Note:**
The application uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL configuration (drizzle.config.ts) but currently implements in-memory storage. The schema is defined using Zod for validation, allowing for future migration to persistent PostgreSQL storage without changing API contracts.

### External Dependencies

**Third-Party APIs:**
- **Polymarket Data API** (https://data-api.polymarket.com): Fetches user positions and trades using wallet addresses
  - `/positions?user=<address>` - Returns position data with fields: asset, title, conditionId, outcome, avgPrice, curPrice, size, cashPnl
  - `/trades?user=<address>&limit=100` - Returns trade history with fields: transactionHash, timestamp, title, side, outcome, price, size
- **Polymarket Gamma API** (https://gamma-api.polymarket.com): Resolves usernames to wallet addresses via public search endpoint
  - `/public-search?q=<username>&search_profiles=true` - Returns user profiles with proxyWallet addresses

**UI Component Libraries:**
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible component primitives (accordion, dialog, dropdown, tabs, toast, tooltip, etc.)
- **Recharts**: Chart library for PnL graphs and volume metrics visualization
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for UI elements

**Development Tools:**
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **Replit Plugins**: Runtime error modal, cartographer, and dev banner for development environment
- **ESBuild**: Server-side bundling for production builds

**Styling and Utilities:**
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework with PostCSS processing
- **class-variance-authority**: Type-safe variant styling for components
- **clsx** and **tailwind-merge**: Conditional class name utilities

**Data Management:**
- **TanStack Query**: Async state management with caching
- **Axios**: HTTP client for external API requests
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation and schema definition
- **date-fns**: Date formatting and manipulation

**Fonts:**
- Google Fonts: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700) for all typography (lighter.gg clean aesthetic)
